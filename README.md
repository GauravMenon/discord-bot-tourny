# Tournament Bot Discord
I created this bot as a self project for my friends and I to use and also to further develop my node.js skills while also learning discord.js. In it's current iteration the bot creates a quick custom match that randomizes teams and creates a gamemode to play based on chosen options.
## Future Plans
* Create a tournament command that has the ability to create either single elimination or double elimination brackets
* Refine quickmatch further to include more games and more settings
* Leaderboard system
## Quickmatch Demo
Here is a demo of the quickmatch command
